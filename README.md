This will be a CLI tool a-la Claude Code that:

1. Accepts a coding task.
2. Chooses from predefined functions to work on the task, e.g.:
    - Scans files in a directory
    - Read file contents
    - Overwrite file contents
    - Execute the python interpreter on a file
3. Repeats step 2 until the task is complete (or also fails catastrophically, womp womp)
